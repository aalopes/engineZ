EngineZ is an on-going project, still in a very early alpha phase,
which aims to be a sort of game engine for side-scrolling games.
At the moment I will be using the sprites from CometZ 
<http://sourceforge.net/projects/cometz/>.

Since I am using the SDL library, this should be multi-platform, I
have indeed tested it successfuly on Linux and Windows.

As for the build mechanism, at the moment I am using GNU's Autotools
(althoug do keep a separate Visual Studio tree for Windows).
